            <p>Originally from Auburn, Washington I now live in Fort Worth, Texas and attend Texas Christian University. Being a student at <strong>TCU</strong> was one of the best decisions I could have ever made. Not only is the sunny weather nice compared to the many rainy days growing up in Washington, but the oppurtunities and friendships I have made I am incredibly grateful for.</p>
    
            <p>I am an English and Writing double major. If you would have told me I would be graduating with a degree in English back in high school, I probably would have laughed because it used to be my worst subject. That's exactly why it grew on me because I had to work really hard to be decent at writing, then I slowly fell in love with it. Now, you can find my short stories and poems published in TCU's Journal of the Arts, <em>eleven40seven</em>.</p>

            <h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>

            <p>Growing up I was always creative and my mom was gracious enough to support my random endeavors. Meaning, I would beg her to take me to Hobby Lobby so I could buy more paints or a needle and thread. I've grown to love art. During the weekends, you can find me volunteering as an exibition host at Amon G. Carter Musuem.</p>

            <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>

            <p>This summer, I was an analyst intern at MUFG. I now have the incredible oppurtunity to continue my internship this school year and was given a return offer post-grad. One goal I have at MUFG is to become a VP within three years post-grad. I also plan to continue writing and hope to have one of my works published outside of TCU.</p>
