            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Auburn, Washington, and now live in Fort Worth, Texas, where I attend Texas Christian University. Choosing TCU has been one of the most rewarding decisions I’ve made—trading rainy skies for sunshine, but more importantly, discovering a community that has shaped both my growth and my goals.</p>
            <p>I’m a double major in English and Writing, though if you had told my high school self that one day I’d earn a degree in English, I wouldn’t have believed you. Back then, it was my hardest subject. But that challenge is exactly what drew me in because I had to work to get better, and somewhere along the way, I fell in love with writing.</p>
            <p>Now, writing is at the center of both my professional and personal life. My short stories and poems have been published in TCU’s Journal of the Arts, eleven40seven, but my work extends beyond the creative sphere. I use writing as a professional tool—whether it’s communicating ideas clearly, crafting persuasive arguments, or tailoring messages for diverse audiences. Writing, for me, is both a passion and a practice.</p>
