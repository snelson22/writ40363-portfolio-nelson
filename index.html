            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Auburn, Washington, and now live in Fort Worth, Texas, where I attend Texas Christian University. Choosing TCU has been one of the most rewarding decisions I've made—trading rainy skies for sunshine, but more importantly, discovering a community that has shaped both my growth and my goals.</p>
            <p>I'm a double major in English and Writing, though if you had told my high school self that one day I'd earn a degree in English, I wouldn't have believed you. Back then, it was my hardest subject. But that challenge is exactly what drew me in because I had to work to get better, and somewhere along the way, I fell in love with writing.</p>
            <p>Now, writing is at the center of both my professional and personal life. My short stories and poems have been published in TCU's Journal of the Arts, <i>eleven40seven</i>, but my work extends beyond the creative sphere. I use writing as a professional tool—whether it's communicating ideas clearly, crafting persuasive arguments, or tailoring messages for diverse audiences. Writing, for me, is both a passion and a practice.</p>

            <h2>My Web Development Journey</h2>
            <p>This semester, I've expanded my skill set into web development, discovering a new creative outlet that merges technical problem-solving with design thinking. Learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has taught me how to bring ideas to life in an interactive, accessible format—skills that complement my background in writing and communication.</p>
            <p>I've learned how to build responsive websites from the ground up, work with data through APIs and JSON, implement user-friendly features like forms and dashboards, and collaborate with AI tools to streamline development. Each project has reinforced the importance of clear structure, thoughtful design, and attention to detail—principles that translate directly from my writing practice.</p>
            <p>What excites me most about web development is its intersection with storytelling and user experience. I'm particularly interested in creating websites that are not only functional but also engaging and accessible to diverse audiences. Whether it's through interactive features, thoughtful content organization, or inclusive design practices, I'm passionate about making the web a more connected and user-centered space.</p>
