            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I grew up in Auburn, Washington, and now live in Fort Worth, Texas, where I attend Texas Christian University. Choosing TCU has been one of the most rewarding decisions I've made—trading rainy skies for sunshine, but more importantly, discovering a community that has shaped both my growth and my goals.</p>
            <p>I'm a double major in English and Writing, though if you had told my high school self that one day I'd earn a degree in English, I wouldn't have believed you. Back then, it was my hardest subject. But that challenge is exactly what drew me in because I had to work to get better, and somewhere along the way, I fell in love with writing.</p>
            <p>Now, writing is at the center of both my professional and personal life. My short stories and poems have been published in TCU's Journal of the Arts, <i>eleven40seven</i>, but my work extends beyond the creative sphere. I use writing as a professional tool—whether it's communicating ideas clearly, crafting persuasive arguments, or tailoring messages for diverse audiences. Writing, for me, is both a passion and a practice.</p>
