                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>The persistent framing of English and writing majors as suited only for teaching, law school, or publishing does a disservice to students. While those are honorable and important professions, they are not the only outcomes—and presenting them as such restricts how students envision their futures. When higher education reinforces a narrow set of career pathways, it undervalues the transferable skills writing majors develop and unintentionally limits their post-graduate opportunities.</p>

                <p>The problem is not employability. The problem is narrative framing.</p>

                <p>Writing majors are already working across industries—finance, consulting, technology, compliance, marketing, nonprofit leadership, logistics, corporate communications, sports media, and beyond. Yet institutions often fail to teach, highlight, or normalize these pathways. If administrators and educators want to support students fully, the narrative must expand inside the classroom and across institutional messaging.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>What the Data Shows</h2>
                <p>In analyzing approximately eleven English and Writing alumni through LinkedIn, a clear pattern emerged: very few are working solely within the stereotypical "English/Writing major" fields i.e. teacher, lawyer, publisher. Instead, they are building careers in corporate, global, and highly technical industries.</p>

                <p>Here are just a few examples:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>A Social Media Manager at The Freeman Company</li>
                    <li>A Senior Sales Consultant/Owner at David Weekley Homes</li>
                    <li>A Product Manager at Cambro Manufacturing</li>
                    <li>A Revenue Specialist at Hilton</li>
                    <li>A Senior Logistics Analyst at The Home Depot</li>
                    <li>A Marketing Specialist at the City of Carrollton</li>
                    <li>A Production Assistant at FOX Sports</li>
                    <li>A Copywriter and Social Media Manager at Spotnana</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>These are not anomalies. They are evidence.</strong></p>

                <p>These alumni are in roles that demand communication strategy, analytical thinking, adaptability, research skills, and rhetorical awareness—precisely the competencies cultivated in writing classrooms. The disconnect lies not in outcomes, but in how institutions describe the major.</p>

                <p>When administrators promote limited examples of success, students internalize limited possibilities. The absence of broader representation reinforces the stereotype. If students never hear about product management, compliance analysis, logistics strategy, or revenue operations as viable pathways, they are less likely to pursue them—even when they are fully qualified.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Skills Are Already There</h2>
                <p>Writing majors develop some of the most adaptable and durable skills in higher education:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Rhetorical awareness (understanding audience, purpose, and context)</li>
                    <li>Critical and analytical thinking</li>
                    <li>Research and synthesis of complex information</li>
                    <li>Audience adaptation across mediums</li>
                    <li>Clear and persuasive written communication</li>
                    <li>Revision and editing precision</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These skills are not confined to the humanities. They are the foundation of leadership, strategy, marketing, consulting, compliance, operations, and cross-functional collaboration.</p>

                <p>Employers consistently rank communication, problem-solving, and critical thinking among their top hiring priorities. The National Association of Colleges and Employers (NACE) continues to report that employers value written communication and analytical reasoning skills at high levels across industries. Writing majors are not lacking in preparation—they are often over-prepared in the very competencies employers seek.</p>

                <figure style="text-align: center; margin: 2rem 0;">
                    <img src="../../images/figure.jpg" alt="Data visualization showing employer priorities" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(47, 36, 58, 0.15);">
                    <figcaption style="margin-top: 1rem; font-size: 0.95rem; color: var(--text-color); font-style: italic;">Figure: Employer hiring priorities highlighting communication and analytical skills</figcaption>
                </figure>

                <p>The issue is that we do not consistently translate these skills into market language.</p>

                <p>When faculty describe an assignment as "a literary analysis," students may struggle to see how that connects to "stakeholder analysis" or "strategic communication." When administrators list "teacher, lawyer, publisher" as example careers, students may not see how research synthesis prepares them for consulting, compliance, or product development.</p>

                <p><em>The framing matters.</em></p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Cross-Industry Demand is Real</h2>

                <p>To further demonstrate this, I am including insight from Neha Jain, a professional working outside a traditional writing field. Her perspective reinforces what alumni data already suggests: writing skills are not niche—they are essential.</p>

                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>💡 Professional Insight:</strong> "In my role, clear communication is critical. Whether I'm presenting data to executives or writing technical documentation, the ability to adapt my message to different audiences is what drives impact. These are the skills I see writing majors excel at—and they're exactly what industries need."
                </div>

                <p>Professionals across industries consistently emphasize the ability to communicate complex ideas clearly, adjust messaging for different audiences, and synthesize information quickly. These are not secondary skills. They are central to leadership and advancement.</p>

                <p>When professionals outside of English-related careers articulate the value of writing competencies, it validates what writing majors already practice daily. It also provides administrators with language that bridges the gap between academia and industry.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>The Ethical Responsibility of Higher Education</h2>
                <p>If writing majors are already working in diverse industries, then institutions have an ethical responsibility to reflect that reality.</p>

                <h3>Administrators and educators must:</h3>

                <p><strong>1. Understand, support, and share careers outside the stereotypical</strong></p>
                <p>Career panels, alumni spotlights, and departmental websites should reflect the actual breadth of outcomes.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Publicize broader career data</strong></p>
                <p>Highlight alumni in finance, tech, healthcare administration, consulting, logistics, marketing, and beyond—not only those in traditional literary fields.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Integrate career literacy into writing curricula</strong></p>
                <p>Help students translate classroom skills into industry terminology. Show them how rhetorical analysis connects to brand strategy, how research synthesis connects to consulting, how revision mirrors quality control.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Partner intentionally with career services</strong></p>
                <p>Writing faculty and career advisors should collaborate to ensure resumes, interviews, and internship pipelines reflect the transferable nature of the major.</p>

                <p>This is not about transforming writing departments into vocational programs. It is about aligning language with reality. Students deserve to see the full landscape of what is possible.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Under-Marketed, Not Under-Qualified</h2>
                <p>Writing majors are not limited. They are under-marketed—beginning within higher education itself. When institutions subtly frame the degree as intellectually rich but professionally narrow, they train generations to undervalue the skills being taught. That framing influences parents, employers, students, and even faculty.</p>

                <p>If higher education shifts the narrative, the ripple effect will follow. Students will graduate with not only strong skills but also confidence in their applicability. Employers will increasingly recognize writing majors as strategic thinkers. Other departments will begin to view humanities students as assets in interdisciplinary collaboration. The narrative begins in the classroom, but it is reinforced at the administrative level.</p>

                <p>If we broaden how we speak about writing majors, we broaden how students see themselves. And when students believe their skills are valuable beyond a stereotype, they pursue opportunities accordingly.</p>

                <!-- Centered conclusion -->
                <p class="conclusion-centered"><strong>The question is no longer, "What can you do with a writing major?"</strong></p>

                <p class="conclusion-centered"><strong>The question is, "Why are we still pretending the answer is small?"</strong></p>
