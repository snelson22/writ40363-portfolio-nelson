            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Originally from Auburn, Washington I now live in Fort Worth, Texas and attend Texas Christian University. Being a student at TCU was one of the best decisions I could have ever made. Not only is the sunny weather nice compared to the many rainy days growing up in Washington, but the opportunities and friendships I have made I am incredibly grateful for.</p>
            <p>I am an English and Writing double major. If you would have told me I would be graduating with a degree in English back in high school, I probably would have laughed because it used to be my worst subject. That's exactly why it grew on me because I had to work hard to be decent at writing, then I slowly fell in love with it. Now, you can find my short stories and poems published in TCU's Journal of the Arts, <i>eleven40seven</i>.</p>

            <p>This summer, I was a Summer Analyst  at MUFG. I now have the incredible opportunity to continue my internship during this school year and was given a return offer post-grad. I also plan to continue writing and hope to have one of my works published outside of TCU.</p>
